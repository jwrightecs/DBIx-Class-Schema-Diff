# ABSTRACT: Simple Diffing of DBIC Schemas
# VERSION

#
# TODO (#2)
#
# The structure/design of this class (+ Source and InfoPacket)
# made more sense before adding the 'SchemaData' feature (#1)
# when these classes were handling both the data extraction from
# DBIC and the diffing tasks of the individual section of data.
# Now the data extraction work is done in SchemaData leaving only
# simple static hashrefs to be dealt with here. These classes should
# probably now be consolidated and generalized. I'm not sure
# how important this is though since everything is already working.
# Later on, if more types of data need to be diffed besides the
# 5 current ones (columns,relationships,constraints,table_name,isa),
# or it is useful to make that more dynamic, such as to be able to
# add more data-points on the fly, then taking the time for 
# refactoring these will make more sense... (2014-04-14 by vanstyn)
